Project Plan for HW1-1: Linear Regression with Streamlit
HW1-1: Interactive Linear Regression Visualizer
Features:
Data Generation:

Generate n data points (x, y) where n is a user-selectable value between 100 and 1000.
The relationship between x and y will be defined by y = ax + b + noise.
a: User-selectable coefficient between -10 and 10.
noise: Normally distributed noise N(0, var), where var (variance) is user-selectable between 0 and 1000.
Linear Regression Visualization:

Plot the generated data points.
Draw the calculated linear regression line in red.
Outlier Identification:

Identify and label the top 5 outliers (points furthest from the regression line).
User Interface:

Implement the application using Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
Allow users to adjust parameters (n, a, var) via sliders or input fields.
Display the generated plot and regression results.
